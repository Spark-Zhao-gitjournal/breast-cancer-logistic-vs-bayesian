# Logistic Regression vs. Bayesian Logistic Regression in Breast Cancer Identification

This project presents a comparative study of Logistic Regression and Bayesian Logistic Regression applied to breast cancer classification. The analysis focuses on:

- **Model Design & Feature Selection**
- **Backward Stepwise Selection**
- **Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity)**
- **Posterior Predictive Checks**
- **Handling Missing Data & Multicollinearity (Correlation Matrix, VIF)**
- **Final Recommendation Based on Evidence**

The PDF files contain the detailed report and results.
